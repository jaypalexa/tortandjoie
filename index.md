        <p><strong>Tort writes:</strong> Joie and I accompanied Mommy and Daddy on their trip to Patagonia and Antarctica.</p>
        <p>We saw many cool things and made a few new friends.</p>
        <p>Eric made us wear toques.</p>
        <p>We have been on all seven continents.  Now we can just nap.</p>
        <p>What’s on your bucket list?</p>

        <h2>Flying Over A Sea Of Tuna</h2>
        <p><strong>Tort writes:</strong> P-nut is gone now.  He gave and received very much love.</p>
        <p>He was Mommy’s sick buddy, Daddy’s work-at-home lap buddy, and everyone’s Little Guy.</p>
        <p>And those whiskers?  Ridiculous.</p>
        <p>Joie and I miss him desperately.</p>
        <p>Daddy hopes he is forgiven.</p>
        <p>Please raise a glass to the ‘nutter.</p>
        <p>Who is your buddy?</p>

        <p><strong>Tort writes:</strong> Sometimes we like to go to our favorite place in Daddy’s mind, grab a pint, and just sit and ponder.</p>

        <h2>Another Day, Another Downer</h2>
        <p><strong>Tort writes:</strong> Congratulations to all you long-suffering Chelsea football fans.</p>
        <p>Your club won the 2012 UEFA Champions League after another season of player mutiny and other Abramovich-inspired drama.</p>
        <p>Another rich, obsessive, tyrant d-bag grabs a shiny new toy for his pram.</p>
        <p>I haven’t had the best run of “my team” winning much of anything lately.</p>
        <p>Not sure why I invest in these sports soap operas.</p>
        <p>Maybe it is time to pursue other interests.  Such as pancakes.  Except Daddy is on a diet.  Grr.</p>
        <p>Are <i>your grapes</i> sour?</p>

        <p>Those guys get a little up-in-your-grill, but we gotta lend a flipper to our land-based cousins, including Lonesome George.</p>
