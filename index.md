        <p><strong>Tort writes:</strong> Thanks to your fireage finding efforts, another milestone has been reached. We have donated $100.00 to <a href="http://www.cinnamon.org.uk/">The Cinnamon Trust</a> – the National Charity for the elderly, terminally ill and their pets.</p>
        <p>Cinnamon Trust is the only specialist national charity which seeks to relieve the anxieties, problems, and sometimes injustices, faced by elderly and terminally ill people and their pets, thereby saving a great deal of human sadness and animal suffering.</p>
        <p>Who are your constant companions?</p>
