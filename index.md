        <p>Joie and I miss him desperately.</p>

        <p>I haven’t had the best run of “my team” winning much of anything lately.</p>
        <p>Not sure why I invest in these sports soap operas.</p>
        <p>Maybe it is time to pursue other interests.  Such as pancakes.  Except Daddy is on a diet.  Grr.</p>

        <p>Mommy and Daddy used to live on the same street.  Even when they moved, they went out of their way to visit Fudge.</p>
        <p>Fudge’s owners were kind enough to put up a notice.  The garden gate where Fudge used to sit and hold court has turned into a bit of a shrine.</p>
        <p>Mommy and Daddy paid their respects as well.  Fudge will be missed by all.</p>

        <p><strong>Tort writes:</strong> Ever since we saw the Northern Royal Albatrosses at Taiaroa Head in New Zealand when visiting there with Mommy and Daddy, we have been fascinated by these birds.</p>
        <p>Even though they are very big and scare us very much (“our whole bodies, Mommy!”), we love them and their awesomeness.</p>
        <p>Today we donated $100.00 of our fireage to BirdLife International’s <a href="http://www.rspb.org.uk/supporting/campaigns/albatross/">Save the Albatross</a> campaign.  We hope it helps.</p>

        <p>Along the way we saw very many <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stile">stiles</a>.  One kind even had a sliding board to let dogs through.</p>
        <p>Mommy and Daddy’s favorite way to pass through a fence is not via a stile, though.  They like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kissing_gate">kissing gates</a>.</p>
        <p>But it does not matter whether they cross using a stile or a gate.  They kiss when they pass through either one.</p>
        <p>So, what’s your stile?</p>

        <p>Along the way, we adopted a new friend.  Her name is Darby.  (That is how you pronounce Derby, but she is very new and did not know how to spell it quite right.)</p>
        <p>Her screeches used to frighten P-Nut, but now he is used to them.</p>

        <p><strong>Tort writes:</strong> When we were in New Zealand, we let Mommy and Daddy know that we really liked pancakes.</p>
        <p>We started singing “Drivin’ down roads, thinkin’ ‘bout pancakes” to the tune of some song in that musical <i>Wicked</i>.  Whatever.  We just like pancakes.</p>
        <p>In Sydney, Australia, we ate at <i>Pancakes on the Rocks</i>.  They had something called an <i>Aussie Sunrise</i> which had pancakes, bacon, bananas, and pineapples.  Mmm.</p>
        <p>Daddy made us pancakes last weekend that were the same as the <i>Aussie Sunrise</i> plus blueberries.  We called it the <i>Aussie Blue Sunrise</i>.  Mmm.</p>

        <p>We hope to see some of our Flatback cousins, but we will probably not because we are not going at the right time.  Crikey.</p>
        <p>We might see some other cousins, though, because we will go swimming during Mommy and Daddy’s scuba dives.</p>
