        <h2>Helping the Elderly and Terminally Ill...and Their Pets</h2>
        <p><strong>Tort writes:</strong> Thanks to your fireage finding efforts, another milestone has been reached. We have donated $100.00 to <a href="http://www.cinnamon.org.uk/">The Cinnamon Trust</a> – the National Charity for the elderly, terminally ill and their pets.</p>
        <p>Cinnamon Trust is the only specialist national charity which seeks to relieve the anxieties, problems, and sometimes injustices, faced by elderly and terminally ill people and their pets, thereby saving a great deal of human sadness and animal suffering.</p>
        <p>Who are your constant companions?</p>

        <p>We saw many cool things and made a few new friends.</p>
        <p>Eric made us wear toques.</p>
        <p>We have been on all seven continents.  Now we can just nap.</p>
        <p>What’s on your bucket list?</p>

        <p>He was Mommy’s sick buddy, Daddy’s work-at-home lap buddy, and everyone’s Little Guy.</p>
        <p>And those whiskers?  Ridiculous.</p>
        <p>Joie and I miss him desperately.</p>
        <p>Daddy hopes he is forgiven.</p>
        <p>Joie and I miss him desperately.</p>
        <p>Please raise a glass to the ‘nutter.</p>
        <p>Who is your buddy?</p>

        <p><strong>Tort writes:</strong> Sometimes we like to go to our favorite place in Daddy’s mind, grab a pint, and just sit and ponder.</p>
