        <p>We saw many cool things and made a few new friends.</p>
        <p>Eric made us wear toques.</p>
        <p>We have been on all seven continents.  Now we can just nap.</p>

        <p>He was Mommy’s sick buddy, Daddy’s work-at-home lap buddy, and everyone’s Little Guy.</p>
        <p>And those whiskers?  Ridiculous.</p>
        <p>Joie and I miss him desperately.</p>
        <p>Daddy hopes he is forgiven.</p>
        <p>Please raise a glass to the ‘nutter.</p>
        <p>Who is your buddy?</p>

        <p><strong>Tort writes:</strong> Congratulations to all you long-suffering Chelsea football fans.</p>
        <p>Your club won the 2012 UEFA Champions League after another season of player mutiny and other Abramovich-inspired drama.</p>
        <p>Another rich, obsessive, tyrant d-bag grabs a shiny new toy for his pram.</p>
        <p>I haven’t had the best run of “my team” winning much of anything lately.</p>
        <p>Not sure why I invest in these sports soap operas.</p>
        <p>Maybe it is time to pursue other interests.  Such as pancakes.  Except Daddy is on a diet.  Grr.</p>
        <p>Are <i>your</i> grapes sour?</p>

        <h2>Fudge Shrine</h2>
        <p><strong>Tort writes:</strong> Fudge – the sweet, three-legged, grumpy-faced cat – died the other day.</p>
        <p>Mommy and Daddy used to live on the same street.  Even when they moved, they went out of their way to visit Fudge.</p>
        <p>Fudge’s owners were kind enough to put up a notice.  The garden gate where Fudge used to sit and hold court has turned into a bit of a shrine.</p>
        <p>Mommy and Daddy paid their respects as well.  Fudge will be missed by all.</p>
        <p>Does your neighborhood have a well-loved cat?</p>

        <p>We like to take Mommy and Daddy down to the <a href="http://www.dukesheadrichmond.com/">local pub</a> and warm ourselves by the fireplace.</p>
        <p>We have to watch out for Lexie pub, though!</p>

        <p>Next month we are all going to Paris for somebody’s 11th anniversary.  Maybe we will go to the original Ladurée.  Je pense que oui?</p>
