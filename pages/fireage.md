<h2>Fireage as of 20 Apr 2016: <strong>$6.82</strong></h2>
  <h3>What is Fireage?</h3>
  <p>Fireage is cash money found in public places and donated to Tort and Joie’s charity fund. Fireage can only be cash money. Fireage can only be money that is truly found, usually in public places. Fireage cannot be money that you “accidentally” dropped and picked up. C’mon. Tort and Joie know what you’re doing. Acceptable sources of Fireage include money found:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>On the ground</li>
    <li>In a payphone</li>
    <li>In a vending machine</li>
    <li>Left behind in your apartment by the previous occupants</li>
    <li>In an ATM</li>
    <li>Foreign currency in your everyday change</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Unacceptable sources of Fireage include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Money found in your washer/dryer</li>
    <li>Money found in your couch cushions</li>
    <li>Money found in your car</li>
    <li>Money given or donated</li>
    <li>Money found in another person’s house or car</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If you have a question about the validity of potential Fireage, ask the Tort or Joie for a ruling. Fireage is not official until the Fireage is fired; that is, put the money in the pouch, people.</p>
  <h3>Countin’ Day</h3>
  <p>Friday is Countin’ Day. Let there be no excuses.</p>
  <p>On each Friday, all Fireage is to be removed from the pouch and tallied.</p>
  <p>Total Fireage must be calculated as US dollars. Foreign currencies must be converted at the exchange rate as of Countin’ Day.</p>
  <p>After the countin’ is done, the Fireage goes back into the pouch.</p>
